Building and documenting a beginner-friendly 5-inch FPV drone from scratch.
# FPV Drone Build

## Project Goal
I am building a beginner-friendly FPV drone from individual components to learn how FPV systems work, including motors, ESCs, flight controllers, firmware setup, and tuning.

## Why This Project
FPV drones combine electronics, software, and mechanical design. This project will help me learn soldering, wiring, firmware configuration, and safe operation of high-speed drones.

## What I Will Build
- A 5-inch FPV quadcopter
- ESC + flight controller stack
- Analog FPV system
- ExpressLRS receiver

## What I Will Learn
- Soldering and wiring electronics
- ESC and motor control
- Betaflight configuration
- PID tuning basics
- FPV safety practices

## Documentation Plan
I will document the full build process with photos, wiring diagrams, setup steps, and a final flight video.
